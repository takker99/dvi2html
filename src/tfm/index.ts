  /*** The first data array is a block of header information, which contains general facts
       about the font.  The header must contain at least two words, and for TFM files to be used
       with Xerox printing software it must contain at least 18 words, allocated as described
       below.

        ``header[0]`` is a 32-bit check sum that TEX will copy into
        the DVI output file whenever it uses the font.  Later on when
        the DVI file is printed, possibly on another computer, the
        actual font that gets used is supposed to have a check sum
        that agrees with the one in the TFM file used by TEX.  In this
        way, users will be warned about potential incompatibilities.
        (However, if the check sum is zero in either the font file or
        the TFM file, no check is made.)  The actual relation between
        this check sum and the rest of the TFM file is not important;
        the check sum is simply an identification number with the
        property that incompatible fonts almost always have distinct
        check sums.

        ``header[1]`` is a fix word containing the design size of the font, in units of TEX points
        (7227 TEX points = 254 cm).  This number must be at least 1.0; it is fairly arbitrary, but
        usually the design size is 10.0 for a "10 point" font, i.e., a font that was designed to
        look best at a 10-point size, whatever that really means.  When a TEX user asks for a font
        "at delta pt", the effect is to override the design size and replace it by delta, and to
        multiply the x and y coordinates of the points in the font image by a factor of delta
        divided by the design size.  All other dimensions in the TFM file are fix word numbers in
        design-size units.  Thus, for example, the value of ``param[6]``, one em or ``\quad``, is
        often the fix word value ``2**20 = 1.0``, since many fonts have a design size equal to one
        em.  The other dimensions must be less than 16 design-size units in absolute value; thus,
        ``header[1]`` and ``param[1]`` are the only fix word entries in the whole TFM file whose
        first byte might be something besides 0 or 255.

        ``header[2 ... 11]``, if present, contains 40 bytes that identify the character coding
        scheme.  The first byte, which must be between 0 and 39, is the number of subsequent ASCII
        bytes actually relevant in this string, which is intended to specify what
        character-code-to-symbol convention is present in the font.  Examples are ASCII for standard
        ASCII, TeX text for fonts like cmr10 and cmti9, TeX math extension for cmex10, XEROX text
        for Xerox fonts, GRAPHIC for special-purpose non- alphabetic fonts, UNSPECIFIED for the
        default case when there is no information.  Parentheses should not appear in this name.
        (Such a string is said to be in BCPL format.)

        ``header[12 ... 16]``, if present, contains 20 bytes that name the font family (e.g., CMR or
        HELVETICA), in BCPL format.  This field is also known as the "font identifier."

        ``header[17]``, if present, contains a first byte called the ``seven_bit_safe_flag``, then
        two bytes that are ignored, and a fourth byte called the *face*.  If the value of the fourth
        byte is less than 18, it has the following interpretation as a "weight, slope, and
        expansion": Add 0 or 2 or 4 (for medium or bold or light) to 0 or 1 (for roman or italic) to
        0 or 6 or 12 (for regular or condensed or extended).  For example, 13 is ``0+1+12``, so it
        represents medium italic extended.  A three-letter code (e.g., MIE) can be used for such
        face data.

        ``header[18 ... whatever]`` might also be present; the individual words are simply called
        ``header[18]``, ``header[19]``, etc., at the moment.

  /** The lig kern array contains instructions in a simple programming language that explains
   *    what to do for special letter pairs. Each word is a lig kern command of four bytes.
   *
   *    * first byte: ``skip_byte``, indicates that this is the final program step if the byte is
   *      128 or more, otherwise the next step is obtained by skipping this number of intervening
   *      steps.
   *    * second byte: ``next_char``, "if ``next_char`` follows the current character, then perform
   *      the operation and stop, otherwise continue."
   *    * third byte: ``op_byte``, indicates a ligature step if less than 128, a kern step otherwise.
   *    * fourth byte: ``remainder``.
   *
   *    In a kern step, an additional space equal to ``kern[256 * (op_byte + 128) + remainder]`` is
   *    inserted between the current character and next char.  This amount is often negative, so
   *    that the characters are brought closer together by kerning; but it might be positive.
   *
   *    There are eight kinds of ligature steps, having ``op_byte`` codes ``4a+2b+c`` where ``0 <= a
   *    <= b+c`` and ``0 <= b; c <= 1``.  The character whose code is remainder is inserted between
   *    the current character and next char; then the current character is deleted if ``b = 0``, and
   *    next char is deleted if ``c = 0``; then we pass over a characters to reach the next current
   *    character (which may have a ligature/kerning program of its own).
   *
   *    Notice that if ``a = 0`` and ``b = 1``, the current character is unchanged; if ``a = b`` and
   *    ``c = 1``, the current character is changed but the next character is unchanged.
   *
   *    If the very first instruction of the lig kern array has ``skip_byte = 255``, the
   *    ``next_char`` byte is the so-called right boundary character of this font; the value of
   *    ``next_char`` need not lie between ``bc`` and ``ec``. If the very last instruction of the
   *    lig kern array has ``skip_byte = 255``, there is a special ligature/kerning program for a
   *    left boundary character, beginning at location ``256 * op_byte + remainder``.  The
   *    interpretation is that TEX puts implicit boundary characters before and after each
   *    consecutive string of characters from the same font.  These implicit characters do not
   *    appear in the output, but they can affect ligatures and kerning.
   *
   *    If the very first instruction of a character's ``lig_kern`` program has ``skip_byte > 128``,
   *    the program actually begins in location ``256 * op_byte + remainder``.  This feature allows
   *    access to large lig kern arrays, because the first instruction must otherwise appear in a
   *    location ``<= 255``.
   *
   *    Any instruction with ``skip_byte > 128`` in the lig kern array must have ``256 * op_byte +
   *    remainder < nl``.  If such an instruction is encountered during normal program execution, it
   *    denotes an unconditional halt; no ligature command is performed.

  /*** Next comes the char info array, which contains one char info word per character.  Each
        char info word contains six fields packed into four bytes as follows.

        * first byte: ``width_index`` (8 bits)
        * second byte: ``height_index`` (4 bits) times 16, plus depth index (4 bits)
        * third byte: ``italic_index`` (6 bits) times 4, plus tag (2 bits)
        * fourth byte: ``remainder`` (8 bits)

        The actual width of a character is ``width[width_index]``, in design-size units; this is a
        device for compressing information, since many characters have the same width.  Since it is
        quite common for many characters to have the same height, depth, or italic correction, the
        TFM format imposes a limit of 16 different heights, 16 different depths, and 64 different
        italic corrections.

        Incidentally, the relation ``width[0] = height[0] = depth[0] = italic[0] = 0`` should
        always hold, so that an index of zero implies a value of zero.  The width index should never
        be zero unless the character does not exist in the font, since a character is valid if and
        only if it lies between ``bc`` and ``ec`` and has a nonzero width index.

        The tag field in a char info word has four values that explain how to interpret the remainder field.

        * ``tag = 0`` (``no_tag``) means that remainder is unused.
        * ``tag = 1`` (``lig_tag``) means that this character has a ligature/kerning program
          starting at ``lig_kern[remainder]``.
        * ``tag = 2`` (``list_tag``) means that this character is part of a chain of characters of
          ascending sizes, and not the largest in the chain.  The remainder field gives the
          character code of the next larger character.
        * ``tag = 3`` (``ext_tag``) means that this character code represents an extensible
          character, i.e., a character that is built up of smaller pieces so that it can be made
          arbitrarily large.  The pieces are specified in ``exten[remainder]``.
        * ``no_tag = 0`` vanilla character
        * ``lig_tag = 1`` character has a ligature/kerning program
        * ``list_tag = 2`` character has a successor in a charlist
        * ``ext_tag = 3`` character is extensible
